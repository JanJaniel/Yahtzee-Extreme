README for Extreme Yahtzee Java Game
Introduction
This game was inspired by a fun evening with friends playing the traditional Yahtzee game. The goal was to recreate the classic game in Java while more "extreme" and fast-paced.

Game Overview
Extreme Yahtzee follows the standard Yahtzee rules, where players roll dice to make certain combinations and score points. However, this version introduces an element of speed.

Key Features
Time-Limited Moves: Each player has only 5 seconds to complete their move. 
Penalty for Delay: If a player fails to make a move within the 5-second window, their turn is skipped, and the next player gets an extended 10-second window for their move.
